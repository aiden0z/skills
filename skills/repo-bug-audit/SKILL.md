# Repo Bug Audit

IRON LAW: Do not submit a Bug unless code evidence, trigger path, realistic failure mode, and impact are all explicit.

## Purpose

Find evidence-backed Bugs and architecture risk signals across one or more repositories, then package the results so developers can review, reproduce, triage, and fix them.

This skill is review-first. Do not patch code unless the user explicitly asks for fixes after the analysis.

## Operating Rules

- Treat findings as static-analysis results until runtime validation proves otherwise.
- Prefer fewer real Bugs over hundreds of weak claims; keep weak leads in `work/candidates/`, not submitted findings.
- Prioritize infra-stability risks: data integrity, recovery, availability, resource leakage, storage/network performance, control-plane safety, security boundaries, and cross-system consistency.
- Use Deep Discussion Mode when the user explicitly asks for `$brainstorming`, when scope/output/risk definitions are still unstable, or when evolving this skill itself.
- Skip Deep Discussion Mode when the user asks for full automatic execution; apply the default workflow and keep progress moving.
- Treat related skills as optional accelerators, not hard dependencies; encourage installation only when they materially improve the current task.
- If a recommended skill is missing, continue by default. Ask before installing anything, and never interrupt explicitly automatic analysis runs for installation.
- Infer safe defaults first. Ask the user only when a missing answer changes safety, scope, or final package semantics.
- Do not infer analyst or author identity from OS username, Git config, directory owner, or model identity; use a provided value or mark it missing.
- In automatic mode, record assumptions in `submit/quality/submission-scope.md` instead of asking.
- Use Chinese for deliverables by default when the user is Chinese. Keep wording natural and developer-facing; avoid meta, self-referential, inflated, or AI-flavored language.
- Keep the skill itself reusable and neutral; do not hardcode real project names, company names, personal names, or analyst identifiers in instructions or examples.
- Do not include SLA fields in Bug records unless the user asks for process management data.
- Use Markdown files with embedded metadata; do not create separate YAML files for individual Bugs.
- Never delete or modify files outside the requested working/output directory unless explicitly asked.

## Deep Discussion Mode

Use this mode before scanning when analysis intent needs design, not just execution.

Do not enter this mode just because a repository group is large. Enter it only when a decision cannot be safely inferred and materially changes scope, risk classification, package format, or user-facing commitments.

Trigger it for:

- User mentions `$brainstorming` or asks to “先思考/先讨论/设计流程”.
- The target includes many repositories, unknown ownership, unclear priorities, or multiple possible output formats.
- The user wants to refine P1-P4 definitions, confidence rules, architecture review style, security scope, package format, image wording, or developer handoff style.
- The task is to improve this Skill or its references/scripts.

In this mode:

- Read `references/deep-discussion.md`.
- If the installed `brainstorming` skill is available, use it to discuss scope, tradeoffs, and deliverable design.
- Keep discussion concrete: produce an analysis charter, not an open-ended brainstorm.
- Ask at most one substantial question at a time unless the user asked for fully automatic execution.
- After the user approves the charter, return to the Workflow Checklist.

## Interaction Policy

- Start work with safe assumptions instead of asking formatting or naming questions.
- Ask at most one question when the answer materially affects safety, target scope, destructive operations, or final package semantics.
- Never ask whether to continue after each phase unless the user requested checkpoints.
- Keep progress updates to phase boundaries or major assumption changes; do not report every candidate Bug.
- Keep optional skill installation suggestions short, one-time, and limited to the most relevant three skills.
- Do not expose `work/` scratch content unless it affects a user decision or the user asks for candidates.
- In automatic mode, do not pause for optional skills, package style choices, image choices, or candidate triage preferences.

## Workflow Checklist

1. **Set scope ⚠️ REQUIRED**
   - Identify target repositories, reference repositories, branch context, output root, provided analyst, analysis date, and package audience.
   - Record audit metadata and repository version evidence when available; use `references/metadata.md`.
   - If the user gives no output root, create a descriptive lowercase workspace under the repo group, with `submit/` for final files and `work/` for temporary artifacts.
   - If the output root already exists or the user asks to continue/deepen/review, read `references/resume-audit.md` before changing findings.

2. **Initialize workspace ⛔ BLOCKING**
   - Run `scripts/init_bug_workspace.py` through Python explicitly to create the output skeleton.
   - Read `references/package-output.md` for directory and packaging conventions.

3. **Build minimal knowledge map ⚠️ REQUIRED**
   - Inventory languages, frameworks, entry points, largest files/functions, external dependencies, background jobs, data stores, and risky integration points.
   - Build enough repo relationship and risk-path knowledge to choose high-risk paths; do not wait for a complete knowledge base before hunting Bugs.
   - Use `references/knowledge-base.md` to separate minimal discovery knowledge from final submitted knowledge.
   - For detailed mapping, use `acquire-codebase-knowledge` if available.

4. **Hunt candidates by risk lens ⚠️ REQUIRED**
   - Use `references/risk-taxonomy.md` for categories, P1-P4 definitions, and confidence rules.
   - Use `references/domain-profiles.md` to choose the primary repository lens.
   - Use `references/security-static-analysis.md` for security-specific checks and tool ideas.
   - Use `references/architecture-review.md` for architecture risk signals.
   - Use `references/candidate-triage.md` for weak leads that should not enter submitted findings yet.

5. **Verify before submitting ⛔ BLOCKING**
   - For each candidate, prove code evidence, trigger path, impact, affected resource, and realistic failure mode.
   - Use `references/deduplication.md` before creating or splitting a Bug.
   - Lower confidence or move to `work/candidates/` if evidence depends on unverified assumptions.
   - Use `systematic-debugging` style reasoning: root cause first, no speculative fixes.

6. **Write Bug records ⚠️ REQUIRED**
   - Use `references/bug-schema.md` for the Markdown metadata and QA-style sections.
   - Use `references/writing-style.md` to keep wording natural and submission-ready.
   - Include priority, confidence, category, issue family, infra domains, evidence, static reproduction path, expected behavior, actual behavior, fix suggestion, and validation checks.
   - Sort and name files as `P1-BUG-0001-short-description.md`.
   - On continuation runs, keep existing IDs stable and continue from the current maximum `BUG-xxxx`.

7. **Consolidate knowledge and architecture risk ⚠️ REQUIRED**
   - Update `submit/knowledge/` after each evidence-backed Bug batch; final repo knowledge should be complete enough for another Agent to continue without rescanning basics.
   - Do this for multi-repo analysis, repeated issue families, cross-system risk paths, or explicit architecture-review requests.
   - For small single-repo scans with few findings, summarize architecture signals in README instead of creating a large review.
   - Use `references/knowledge-base.md` to check final knowledge completeness.
   - Write `knowledge/architecture-design-review.md` from a discovery perspective.
   - 将“用例、适配器、Saga/Outbox、状态对账”等架构信号写成风险发现，不写成命令或原则。

8. **Generate indexes, validate, and evaluate ⛔ BLOCKING**
   - Run `scripts/generate_bug_index.py`.
   - Run `scripts/validate_bug_package.py`.
   - For final handoff packages in large or multi-repo audits, run `scripts/validate_bug_package.py --require-knowledge --require-image` when `audit-overview.png` is expected.
   - Read `references/evaluation.md`.
   - Evaluate all P1/P2 Bugs; for large packages, also sample each issue family and risk domain.
   - Record material downgrades, removals, merges, priority changes, or weak areas in `quality/submission-scope.md`.
   - Fix missing metadata, stale counts, oversize images, old terminology, duplicate content, weak evidence, or priority inflation.

9. **Package (conditional)**
   - Add `README.md`, indexes, knowledge docs, quality scope, standards, and optional `audit-overview.png` under `submit/`.
   - If creating `audit-overview.png`, use `references/audit-overview-image.md` for content, layout, color, metadata, and wording constraints.
   - Prefer HTML/CSS screenshot for dense text and exact numbers; native image generation is allowed after visual and data consistency review.
   - For HTML/CSS overview images, verify both the exported PNG and a constrained browser preview; avoid long vertical canvases, stale browser tabs, scrolling screenshots, and fixed canvases that crop in common viewports.
   - Apply `references/writing-style.md` to README, knowledge docs, Bug records, and image text.
   - Keep zip packages small; compress images and avoid unused large assets.

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

- `scripts/validate_bug_package.py` reports zero errors.
- `indexes/findings.generated.md` and `indexes/findings.generated.json` are current.
- Every submitted Bug has P1-P4 priority, high/medium/low confidence, `status=open`, and `source=static-analysis`.
- Every submitted Bug has code evidence, static reproduction path, false-positive review, fix suggestion, and validation standard.
- P1/P2 Bugs pass `references/evaluation.md` priority and evidence gates.
- Large packages have issue-family and risk-domain samples checked through `references/evaluation.md`.
- `work/candidates/` contains weak leads instead of mixing them into submitted findings.
- Candidate notes follow the lightweight format in `references/candidate-triage.md`.
- Duplicate Bugs have been merged or moved to `work/candidates/`.
- `work/` is excluded from the final zip/package.
- Final `submit/knowledge/` meets `references/knowledge-base.md`; remove empty or repetitive optional files before packaging.
- For large or multi-repo packages, `scripts/validate_bug_package.py --require-knowledge` passes.
- If `audit-overview.png` is part of the package, image content follows `references/audit-overview-image.md`.
- If `audit-overview.html` is used to create the image, a common browser viewport can show the whole artboard without clipping, and the final PNG is visually reviewed for compression, overlap, stale layout, and accidental empty space.
- README counts match generated indexes.
- `quality/repository-versions.md` records branch, commit hash, and dirty status when available; missing version evidence is marked rather than guessed.
- Package text avoids banned/meta wording and project-specific residue.
- Package text has no process explanation, self-reference, vague summary claims, or AI-flavored phrasing.
- Images are compressed and no unused large assets remain.

## Tooling Guidance

- Use `rg` / `rg --files` for searches when available.
- Read `references/cross-platform.md` before running shell commands on Windows, Linux, macOS, or when a suggested command fails.
- Run bundled scripts through Python explicitly; do not rely on Unix executable bits or shebang behavior.
- Use Semgrep, CodeQL, dependency scanners, secret scanners, or language-native linters when available, but never submit raw tool output without human triage.
- Use multiple passes: broad pattern search, module-level tracing, cross-repo call-chain review, then false-positive pass.
- For large repo groups, analyze by domain: compute, storage, network, deployment, identity, billing, monitoring, UI/API.
